Hi, I'm Jana Gunn. With almost 20 years of experience in the healthcare industry, I’ve had the opportunity to work in many different areas including data science, healthcare economics, clinical analytics, financial analytics, pricing, underwriting and reporting. I thrive on solving complex business problems and enjoy developing new insights and products that add value to the company. I'm also an instructor, teaching online classes on data and analytics in healthcare. My students range from those who are just getting started in the field to seasoned professionals that want to increase their knowledge of healthcare data and analytics. Teaching is a passion of mine, and I love seeing others be as excited about analytics as I am!
